            <p>HSMF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Outlook MSG format.</p>
			<p>At this time, it provides simple read access to some of the
			   textual content of MSG files. Further support and documentation
			   is expected over the comming weeks and months. For now, users
			   are advised to consult the unit tests for example use.</p>
            <note> 
                This code currently lives the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
                of the POI SVN repository. 
				Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
                build area in your
				classpath before experimenting with this code.
